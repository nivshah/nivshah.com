      <div id="about">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I currently am the Senior Product Manager for Ad Products at <a href="http://voxmedia.com/">Vox Media</a>. Before working at Vox Media, I launched my own <a href="http://ottoneu.fangraphs.com/">fantasy sports startup</a> and sold
        a game I created and developed to Vox Media and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/">SB Nation</a>. I've also worked at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plusmo">Plusmo</a> (acquired by AT&amp;T Interactive, 2010),
        <a href="http://www.emc.com/domains/rsa/index.htm">RSA Security</a>, and <a href="http://monster.com/">Monster.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Like I wrote above, I enjoy building things that make people happy. Sometimes this means improving a tool for a small internal team, and other times this means launching a new product to millions of users. Ultimately I excel at
        understanding and then building what customers want, either on my own or by leading a team.</p>
