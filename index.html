        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I have led cross-disciplinary teams with product and revenue stakeholders, and I have built products from the prototype phase all the way to production. I'd love to <a href="mailto:nivshah@gmail.com">hear from you</a> and help you with your project!</p>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>I'm comfortable with PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, and jQuery. I've worked extensively with MySQL, as well.</p>

        <h3>Recent contracts</h3>
        <p>I am currently working with <a href="http://tourneymachine.com/">Tourney Machine</a> to establish their display advertising strategy. Previously, I developed the user-facing dashboard for <a href="http://www.arcadiapower.com/">Arcadia Power</a> in Rails.</p>

        <h3>Recent work</h3>
        <p>I am working on <a href="http://ottoneu.fangraphs.com/">ottoneu Fantasy Sports</a>, a dynasty fantasy sports game I founded in 2011. Previously I was the Senior Product Manager for Ad Products at <a href="http://voxmedia.com/">Vox Media</a>, where I co-created VAX, Vox Media's annual product team hackathon. I created and developed a daily fantasy sports game, Pick 6, in 2011 and subsequently sold it to Vox Media and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/">SB Nation</a> later that same year. I've also worked at <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plusmo">Plusmo</a> (acquired by AT&amp;T Interactive, 2010), <a href="http://www.emc.com/domains/rsa/index.htm">RSA Security</a>, and <a href="http://monster.com/">Monster.com</a>.</p>
